      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The first time I lost sleep because of my studies was at the age of four. I still remember staying up late with my mom, drilling flashcards so that I could learn a second language. I have come a long way since then. I have earned my B.A. in Anthropology in 2014 with honors. I also earned my M.A. in Education in 2018 (with a 3.9 G.P.A). With this webpage, I am on my way to become a web developer.</p>
